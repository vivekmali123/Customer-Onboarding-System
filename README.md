# Camunda Spring Boot Application
Spring Boot Application using [Camunda](http://docs.camunda.org).

# Customer On Boarding System
Customer onboarding is the process that a new customer goes through in order to start using a product or service that they've agreed to purchase. It covers the entire journey from the moment the sales team convinces them to move forward until they are fully integrated into using what your business has to offer. I built this project with prespective of Bank.

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-spring-boot-7.21.0](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-applications/maven-archetypes/).

## Used Camunda BPM, that allows organizations to pause business processes, implement changes, and re-execute them.
[BPMN Process](src/main/resources/process.bpmn)

## For using this project you need to download camunda mudaler and integrate it with ide.
